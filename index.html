### Homework #1 - Commmand Line

The goal of this homework is to get you familiar with how to use the CLI.

1. Create a file in your CLI folder called `commands.md`

    - You can paste your queries into the file and commit it to Github.

1. Perform the following using your CLI - NO GUI!!:
 
    1. In your CLI folder, create a folder named "soups".
    1. Go inside of your soups folder. Create a file called "ChickenNoodle.html" and "BakedPotato.css"
    1. While you are inside of the soups folder, create another folder called "js".
    1. Go inside of the js folder. 
    1. Where are we? Display the current path that we are on.
    1. Now go back 'up' to the soups folder.
    1. Create a file called "CreamyTomato.js" and put it in the js folder while still in the soups folder.
    1. Create a file called "readme.txt." in the soups folder.
    1. On second thought, maybe we do not need a readme file. Delete "readme.txt".
    1. Go into the js folder.
    1. You decide you are not in the mood for creamy tomato. Rename "CreamyTomato.js" to "BroccoliCheddar.js".

### Homework #2 - Command Line Part 2

This homework will build on what you learned from homework 1.

**Note:** for this homework, you cannot use the `"cd"` command at all once you are in the CLI path. Do everything from the CLI path of your command line.

1. Create a file called `commands2.md`

1. Perform the following using your CLI - NO GUI!!:

    1. In your CLI folder, create a folder called "drinks".
    1. Inside of drinks, create three folders: Smoothies, FrozenDrinks and IcedSpecialtyDrinks.
    1. Rename the "Smoothies" folder to "PowerSmoothies".
    1. Inside of PowerSmoothies, create three files: 
        1. PeachAndBlueberry.txt 
        2. GreenPassion.txt
        3. Superfruit.txt
    1. Inside of FrozenDrinks, create three files: 
        1. Lemonade.html 
        2. Caramel.html 
        3. Mocha.html
    1. Inside of IcedSpecialityDrinks, create four files: 
        1. CaramelLatte.css 
        2. ChaiTeaLatte.css
        3. CaffeMocha.css 
        4. CaffeLatte.css
    1. Delete CaffeLatte.css. 

That's enough caffeine for today!

### Homework #3 - Command Line

You may have to look at the `Command Line` readings for reference or do some online searches.

Answer as many as you can.

1. Create a file called `commands3.md`

    You can paste your answers into the file and submit to Github.

1. Please answer the following questions.

    1. What command would you use to clear the terminal?

    1. What is the shortcut command to open a new tab in your terminal?

    1. What key would you use to scroll through previous commands you've typed before?

    1. You have three txt files and an empty folder in your CLI folder. Write a single line command that will move all three txt files into the folder.

    1. You want to inspect the differences between two txt files, file1.txt and file2.txt. Write a command that would display the differences in content between these two files.

    1. Write a command that would delete this folder and all of the contents inside.

    1. What is the command to list all files, including hidden files?  Write a command that displays all .css files in a folder.

    1. What is the command to find a file by name on your disk (or some other storage medium)?

    1. What is the command to find a file by content
        - in your folder 
        - on the disk?  
          - That is, how do you search for a word or phrase in the file contents?

    1. Use a bash command to create a file named YourName.txt with no content in it.  Look at the permissions.
        - Now change the permissions so everyone can read it and execute it.  
        - Now change the permissions so only you can read it.

### Homework #4 - Command Line - Permissions

1. Create a file called `permissions.txt`
   
1. Pipe the output of the `ls -al` command to a file called `permissions.txt`

1. Check the permissions on the file.  What do you see?

1. Change the permissions on the file so that only you can read it, and write to it. No other permissions are given to you or to any other user on your computer. Use both the letter method, e.g. `chmod u=rw permissions.txt` and the octal method, e.g. `chmod 600 permissions.txt`.  What do you see when you run `ls -al`?

   
You can paste your answers into the file and submit to Github, once you have access to git and github figured out.
